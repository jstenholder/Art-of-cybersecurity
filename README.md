# Art-of-cybersecurity

Hello everyone! Thank you for your interest in my game!

## Download & Run
Feel free to look through my source code, but if you want to get right into the game, you can download the latest version of the project here: https://github.com/jstenholder/Art-of-cybersecurity/releases/tag/v1.0.0

Under *Assets*, download *Art.of.Cybersecurity.exe*

Once downloaded:
1. Unzip the file (if its zipped)
2. Double click the .exe to run the game
3. If you see a warning from Windows SmartScreen, click **"More info" → "Run anyway"**

Note: You may need to right-click the file, go to **Properties**, and click **"Unblock"** under Security if Windows prevents it from running

## Requirements

No need to install Python or any dependencies — just download and play!
